        <li>Rooms had no such cupboard or almirahs provided in it.</li>
        <li>We cant even lock door when we go out ,no privacy to our rooms.</li>
        <li>Seniors are Cool and intresting and always ready to help and give advice to us for our own good.</li>
        <li>Mess food is really decent than i had thought..I liked the menu, timings and the food ofcourse and costs very less.</li>
        <li>Gender ratio is hopeless.</li>
        <li>Roommate is helpful and quite well behaved.</li>
        <li>Theres hardly any free time and also Lots of assignment are assigned to us.</li>
        <li>We need to travel some distance to access all shops and requirements.</li>
        <li>Teachers are the best and gave us the freedom to consult to them for any issues or doubts anytime.</li>
